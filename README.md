## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the SkillShare application running locally.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+) and npm/yarn
- A running instance of MongoDB (local or cloud-hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
cd [Your Repository Name]
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup (`/server` folder)

1. Navigate into the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install real-time libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install socket.io
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory and configure your MongoDB connection and secrets:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<USER>:<PASS>@<CLUSTER>/skillsharedb?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
   JWT_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_SECRET_KEY"
   ```

5. Seed the database (required for testing map and sessions):
   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```

6. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 3: Frontend Setup (`/client` folder)

1. Open a new terminal tab and navigate into the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. Install dependencies, including the necessary client-side libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install socket.io-client react-leaflet leaflet react-datepicker date-fns
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by your Vite/React setup)
